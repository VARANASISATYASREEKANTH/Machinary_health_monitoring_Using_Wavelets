# Machinary_health_monitoring_Using_Wavelets(Bearings and Gear Box)
Heavy equipment (pumps, motors, gearboxes, excavators, blowers, centrifuges, etc.) often operates under harsh conditions, leading to:  Wear and tear  Unexpected breakdowns  High maintenance costs  Unplanned downtime affecting productivity  The goal is early fault detection before catastrophic failure.
# Interpreting Bearing and Gearbox Faults Using Spectrograms

Spectrograms are a powerful tool for diagnosing rotating machinery faults such as **bearing defects** and **gearbox failures**. Unlike a simple FFT, spectrograms provide a **time–frequency representation** of vibration signals, making them suitable for detecting transient faults and modulations.

---

## 📊 Basics of Spectrograms
- **X-axis:** Time (s)  
- **Y-axis:** Frequency (Hz)  
- **Color intensity:** Amplitude (energy at that frequency and time)  

---

## 🛠️ Bearing Faults in Spectrograms
Rolling element bearings have characteristic defect frequencies:

- **BPFO** – Ball Pass Frequency Outer race  
- **BPFI** – Ball Pass Frequency Inner race  
- **BSF** – Ball Spin Frequency  
- **FTF** – Fundamental Train Frequency  

### 🔍 What to Look For:
- **Outer race defect**
  - Strong harmonics at **BPFO**  
  - Localized periodic energy bursts  
  - Sidebands around shaft frequency  

- **Inner race defect**
  - Harmonics at **BPFI**  
  - Continuous frequency bands  
  - Energy concentrated at higher frequencies  

- **Rolling element defect**
  - Broad frequency spread (random impacts)  
  - High-frequency modulated bands (BSF components)  

- **Cage defect**
  - Low-frequency bands at **FTF**  
  - Intermittent high-frequency sidebands  

👉 Bearing faults generally show **periodic impulses** that produce **harmonics and sidebands**.

---

## ⚙️ Gearbox Faults in Spectrograms
Gearboxes introduce strong tonal components at **gear mesh frequencies (GMF):**

- **GMF = Number of Teeth × Shaft Speed**

### 🔍 What to Look For:
- **Gear tooth wear/breakage**
  - Sideband growth around **GMF**  
  - “Comb-like” modulation patterns  

- **Eccentricity / misalignment**
  - Sidebands around GMF harmonics  
  - Low-frequency energy spread  

- **Cracked gear**
  - Localized bursts at GMF  
  - Asymmetric spectrogram patterns  

- **Multiple gear stages**
  - Multiple GMFs present  
  - Overlapping sideband patterns  

👉 Gearbox faults usually show **modulation sidebands** around GMF, unlike bearings which show **impulses and defect harmonics**.

---

## 🔄 Practical Interpretation Steps
1. Establish a **baseline** (compare with healthy spectrogram).  
2. Identify **recurring patterns**:
   - Impulses → Bearing fault  
   - Sidebands at GMF → Gearbox fault  
3. Match observed frequencies with **calculated fault frequencies** (using shaft speed, gear teeth, bearing geometry).  
4. Inspect **high-frequency ranges** for early-stage bearing faults.  
5. Track **amplitude growth** and **frequency spreading** over time.  

---

## 👀 Visual Cues
- **Bearing Faults:** Impulse-like **vertical streaks** (short bursts across frequency).  
- **Gearbox Faults:** **Horizontal bands** at GMF with **sideband combs**.  
- **Healthy Machine:** Clear, stable tonal lines (shaft harmonics, GMF) without excessive sidebands.  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
You can simulate and visualize spectrograms in Python using vibration signals (healthy vs faulty) to get hands-on practice.  
If needed, I can provide **sample code to generate synthetic spectrograms** with annotated fault signatures.

# ⚙️ Bearing Characteristic Frequencies for NASA IMS Dataset

This document explains how to compute and interpret **bearing defect characteristic frequencies** for the **NASA IMS Bearing Dataset** (Rexnord ZA-2115 / 2115U insert bearings).  
It includes formulas, example calculations using IMS operating conditions, and a Python script for direct computation.

---

## 📂 1) Dataset & Bearings

- \( n \) = number of rolling elements (balls/rollers)  
- \( d \) = rolling element diameter (mm)  
- \( D \) = pitch diameter (mm)  
- \( \theta \) = contact angle (rad)  

**Formulas:**

\]

- **Ball Spin Frequency (BSF):**
\[
$BSF = \frac{D}{2d} f_r \left(1 - \left(\frac{d}{D} \cos \theta \right)^2\right)$
\]

- **Fundamental Train Frequency (FTF, cage frequency):**
\[

\]

---

## ⚙️ 3) IMS Operating Parameters

- **Bearing**: Rexnord ZA-2115 / 2115U  
- **Geometry Needed**: roller count (\(n\)), roller diameter (\(d\)), pitch diameter (\(D\))  

👉 The public product pages provide bore & OD, but **internal geometry (n, d, D)** must come from a datasheet or measurement.

---

## 🧮 4) Example Calculation (Assumptions)
*(illustrative values — replace with true dimensions when available)*

- \( f_r = 33.33\ \text{Hz} \)  
- \( n = 18 \) rollers  
- \( d = 10.0\ \text{mm} \)  
- \( D = 69.6\ \text{mm} \)  
- \( \theta = 0^\circ \)

---

## 🐍 5) Python Script for bearing frequencies


import math

def bearing_characteristic_freqs(rpm, n, d_mm, D_mm, theta_deg=0.0):
    fr = rpm / 60.0  # shaft freq in Hz
    theta = math.radians(theta_deg)
    d = d_mm
    D = D_mm

    BPFO = (n/2.0) * fr * (1.0 - (d/D) * math.cos(theta))
    BPFI = (n/2.0) * fr * (1.0 + (d/D) * math.cos(theta))
    BSF = (D/(2.0*d)) * fr * (1.0 - ((d/D) * math.cos(theta))**2)
    FTF = 0.5 * fr * (1.0 - (d/D) * math.cos(theta))
    return {"fr_Hz": fr, "BPFO_Hz": BPFO, "BPFI_Hz": BPFI, "BSF_Hz": BSF, "FTF_Hz": FTF}

# Example (replace with real geometry values):
rpm = 2000
n = 18           # number of rollers (replace with actual)
d_mm = 10.0      # roller diameter in mm
D_mm = 69.6      # pitch diameter in mm
theta_deg = 0.0

freqs = bearing_characteristic_freqs(rpm, n, d_mm, D_mm, theta_deg)
for k,v in freqs.items():
    print(f"{k}: {v:.2f} Hz"



## 📌 Notes

# Gear Defect Detection Using Spectrograms

This guide explains how to identify **gear defects** (cracks, chipped teeth, misalignment, wear, looseness) using **time–frequency analysis with spectrograms**.  

---

## 1. Why Spectrograms for Gears
A spectrogram shows how spectral content evolves over time. Gear defects usually produce **time-varying impulses and modulations** of gear-mesh frequencies and harmonics — which spectrograms highlight clearly.

---

## 2. Fault Signatures to Look For
- **Cracked / Chipped Tooth (Impact):**  
  Short impulses → broadband bursts in spectrogram, repeating at once-per-revolution or mesh intervals.
- **Pitting / Spalling / Wear:**  
  Growing high-frequency energy and broadband noise.
- **Misalignment / Eccentricity:**  
  Amplitude modulation of gear-mesh frequency → sidebands around GMF.
- **Looseness:**  
  Irregular low-frequency energy and sidebands, often broadband.
- **Broken Tooth:**  
  Strong impulses at shaft rotation multiples, appearing/disappearing in spectrogram.

---

## 3. Gear Mesh Frequency (GMF)
\[
GMF = \text{Shaft Rotational Frequency (Hz)} \times \text{Number of Teeth}
\]

Example: Shaft speed = 1800 RPM = 30 Hz, Pinion = 20 teeth → **GMF = 30 × 20 = 600 Hz**.  
Defect sidebands appear at `GMF ± n × shaft_rotation_freq`.

---

## 4. Analysis Pipeline
1. **Acquire Data**  
   - Accelerometer on gear housing/shaft  
   - Sampling rate ≥ 5–10× highest GMF harmonic  
2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Remove DC offset, anti-aliasing, optional order tracking  
3. **Compute Spectrogram (STFT)**  
   - Hanning window, N=2048 (adjust to balance resolution), overlap 50–75%  
   - Use dB scale for visualization  
4. **Envelope Analysis**  
   - Bandpass filter → Hilbert transform → envelope → FFT of envelope  
5. **Feature Extraction**  
   - GMF peaks, harmonics, sidebands, broadband energy, kurtosis, RMS  
6. **Detection Rules**  
   - Growth of GMF sidebands  
   - Broadband noise increase  
   - Peaks in envelope spectrum at shaft or mesh-related frequencies  

---

## 5. Detection Heuristics
- **Periodic impulses + envelope FFT peaks at tooth-pass rate → Tooth damage.**  
- **Broadband spectral rise → Wear or distributed damage.**  
- **Symmetric GMF sidebands → Misalignment or looseness.**

---
